\subsubsection*{MISSION STATEMENT}

Our goal is to inspire people and communities to take action on
climate change. Our unique approach is to connect climate-consious
consumers with cost-saving methods for improving their energy
efficiency.

\subsubsection*{MOTIVATION}

Across all nations, cultures, and creeds, we hope that the world we
pass to our children and grandchildren is better than the world we
inhereted from the generations that came before us. Unfortunately, the
Earth's climate is changing at an unprecedented pace. As climate
change accelerates, many of the things we take for granted -- ample
food, safe water, and stable shelter -- are increasingly more
vulnerable. Bold action is needed in order to protect the well-being
of our children and grandchildren.\\

\noindent
Fortunately, there are tremendous opportunities to do better. Most of
the climate-warming pollution is from energy use, and numerous
technologies are available to reduce your energy use at home and at
work. Many of these can save you money as well. However, there is no
one-size-fits-all solution. The most cost-effective methods really
depend on the situation. Our organization strives to connect
climate-concious consumers with cost-effective solutions in order to
({\it i}) and reduce the impacts of climate change and ({\it ii})
acheive economic sustainability by reducing costs over the long term.

\subsubsection*{COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY}

Climate change is a contentious issue. Our commitment to integrity is
critically important. We work to insure that the information we
distribute is credible -- meeting the criteria of the international
science community -- and specific, that is relevant to users in a
tangible and even visceral way. Furthermore, we only include energy
efficiency solutions that are provably effective over the entire
life-cylce of the product or service.
