\opening{Dear Professor Wu:}

Thank you for considering my application for Assistant Professor of
Air Resources in the Engineering School of Sustainable Infrastructure
and Environment. I am deeply passionate about finding solutions to
environmental challenges at the interface of climate change,
atmospheric chemistry, and public policy. As a graduate student, my
training included computer science, environmental engineering, and
policy analysis. For the past six years at EPA, I have been
responsible for organizing, building, and leading teams of researchers
focused on the development, evaluation, and application of global and
regional atmospheric chemical transport models.  During this time, my
research has been centered around short-lived climate forcers --
aerosols and gases that both perturb the Earth's energy balance and
degrade human health. Specifically, questions I am focused on include

\begin{itemize}
\item What are the world-wide spatial and temporal distribution of pollutant emissions?
\item What are the origins, radiative effects, and health impacts of organic aerosols?
\item What energy technologies can improve human health and mitigate
  climate change at the same time?
\end{itemize}

I have worked to answer these questions through the development of
advanced chemical transport models, satellite-based remote sensing,
and statistical analysis. I am especially interested in bringing these
tools to collaborative projects with colleagues across Georgia Tech.

I have described my experience and publication record more
specifically in the attached curriculum vitae, research and teaching
statements, and representative publications.\\

\noindent
Thank you for your consideration of my application.\\
